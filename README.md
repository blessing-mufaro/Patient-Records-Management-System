# üè• Patient-Records-Management-System

This was a sophomore group project I completed with 4 of my classmates as a capstone project fulfilling sucessful completion of the first two years of our undergraduate degree program (B. Tech (Hons) Information Security and Assurance).

# üìÑ Abstract

Made for the Harare Institute of Technology Campus Clinic

The essence of the project will be to eliminate various shortcomings of the traditional operation of the clinic pertaining to the storage and manipulation of patients‚Äô records. The major problems that will be addressed are: record inconsistency, loss of physical records, unavailability of past records by patients and lack of ease of access to records. The project‚Äôs focus is on the development of a web application that will hopefully eliminate all these issues. The system will be available to the patients and medical practitioners from anywhere across the globe to aid for remote consultations even when both parties are not physically present. It will also aid the secure storage of patient records on a cloud database that will be accessible from within the system; although everyone capable of retrieving this information will have different access rights based on their credentials. This will be done to maintain information security (confidentiality of patient records).
